# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with text analysis and understanding. Some of the fields in which NLP is widely used are sentiment classification, spam detection and topic detection. Deep Learning is one of the tools that helps us solving NLP problems.

# Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG deals with writing language an turning stuructured data in text (whether written or oral).

# Transfer Learning 
As most deep learning models require huge amount of data to train well and that amount of data is not usually available, transfer learning is used.

1. The model is trained on large dataset (pre-training).
2. The pretrained model is adapted on your small dataset (fine-tuning).

## Activities planned
* Create powerful NLP based Deep Learning Models with PyTorch.
* Create simple applications using deep learning models. 
* Write essays with the help of AI.
* Fine tune stylized chat bots with AI.
* Interact with AI 
* Have FUN !!!

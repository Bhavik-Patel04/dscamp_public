Natural Language Generation
## Essay Writing
In this project, we use NLG models to generate essays. For that purpose we load GPT2 pretrained model an fine tune it on specific topics. You can see how fine tuning can help you stylize your chatbot.


## Chatbot

In this project you will have a conversation with AI. This is similar to something you might have seen in many websites. The AI model is a machine learning model that generates english language given some initial sentences. We are going to use the free GPU environment provided by Google in the form of [google colabratory](colab.research.google.com).
